\section{SMP Extreme True And/Or False}

Each of the following problems represents a SMP scenario (with $n$ employers and $n$ applicants) and a statement about that scenario. Each statement may be \textbf{always} true, \textbf{sometimes} true, or \textbf{never} true. Select the best of these three choices and then:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If the statement is \textbf{always} true, (a) give, and very briefly explain, an example instance in which it is true and (b) prove that it is always true.
	\item If the statement is \textbf{never} true, (a) give, and very briefly explain, an example instance in which it is false and (b) prove that it is always false.
	\item If the statement is \textbf{sometimes} true, (a) give, and very briefly explain, an example in which it is true and (b) give and very briefly explain an example instance in which it is false.
\end{itemize}
Here are the problems:

\begin{questions}
	\question[3] \textbf{Scenario:} an SMP instance with $n \ge 2$. \textbf{Statement:} there is exactly one stable matching.

	\question[4] \textbf{Scenario:} an SMP instance with $n \ge 2$. \textbf{Statement:} there exists a stable matching in which nobody gets their first choice.

	\question[4] \textbf{Scenario:} an SMP instance with $n \ge 2$ where all employers have identical preference lists. \textbf{Statement:} there is exactly one stable matching.

	\(\exists (e, a) \notin M\) such that \(e\) prefers \(a\) over their current and \(a\) prefers \(e\) over their current, unstable.

	\begin{soln}
		This is sometimes true and sometimes false.
		For example consider the following instance:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	\(e_1 : a_1, a_2\)
			\item \(e_2 : a_1, a_2\)
			\item \(a_1 : e_1, e_2\)
			\item \(a_2 : e_1, e_2\)
		\end{itemize}
		The only possible solutions would be \(M_1 = \{(e_1, a_1), (e_2, a_2)\}\) and \(M_2 = \{(e_1, a_2), (e_2, a_1)\}\).
		But \(M_2\) is not stable since \((e_1, a_1) \notin M_2\) but \(e_1\) prefers \(a_1\) over \(a_2\) and \(a_1\) prefers \(e_1\) over \(e_2\).
		Since \(G-S\) guarantees a solutino then \(M_1\) is a solution.

		Then consider the next example consider the following instance:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item	\(e_1 : a_1, a_2\)
			\item \(e_2 : a_2, a_1\)
			\item \(a_1 : e_2, e_1\)
			\item \(a_2 : e_1, e_2\)
		\end{itemize}
		The only possible solutions for this one is \(M_1 = \{(e_1, a_1), (e_2, a_2)\}\) and \(M_2 = \{(e_1, a_2), (e_2, a_1)\}\).

		But in this case, both \(M_1, M_2\) are stable.
	\end{soln}


	\question[4] \textbf{Scenario:} an SMP instance with $n \ge 2$. \textbf{Statement:} there exists a stable matching in which nobody gets their first choice.

	\begin{soln}
		This is sometimes true and sometimes false.

		Consider the following instance
		\begin{itemize}
			\item item
		\end{itemize}

	\question[4] \textbf{Scenario:} an SMP instance with $n \ge 2$ where all employers have identical preference lists. \textbf{Statement:} there is exactly one stable matching.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item	\(e_1 : a_1, a_2\)
		\item \(e_2 : a_1, a_2\)
		\item \(a_1 : a_1, a_2\)
		\item \(a_2 : a_1, a_2\)
	\end{itemize}

	\ifsolutions\input{q1c-sol.tex}\fi

	\(\exists (e, a) \notin M\) such that \(e\) prefers \(a\) over their current and \(a\) prefers \(e\) over their current, unstable.

	\begin{soln}

		By \(G-S\) algorithm we are guaranteed one solution. Then suppose that there exists another solution \(M'\) such that \(M' \neq M\).

		We know that each employer gets the best possible applicant they can get and also that the applicants will get the worse possible employer they can get.

		Then we have that for some \((e, a) \in M\) that \((e, a) \notin M'\).

		Then we get that \((e, a'), (e', a) \in M'\) for some \(e', a'\).

		We know \(e\) and \(e'\) share the same applicant list and thus either \(a'\) ranks higher than \(a\) or the other way.
