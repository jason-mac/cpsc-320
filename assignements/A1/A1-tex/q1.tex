\section{SMP Extreme True And/Or False}

Each of the following problems represents a SMP scenario (with $n$ employers and $n$ applicants) and a statement about that scenario. Each statement may be \textbf{always} true, \textbf{sometimes} true, or \textbf{never} true. Select the best of these three choices and then:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If the statement is \textbf{always} true, (a) give, and very briefly explain, an example instance in which it is true and (b) prove that it is always true.
	\item If the statement is \textbf{never} true, (a) give, and very briefly explain, an example instance in which it is false and (b) prove that it is always false.
	\item If the statement is \textbf{sometimes} true, (a) give, and very briefly explain, an example in which it is true and (b) give and very briefly explain an example instance in which it is false.
\end{itemize}
Here are the problems:

\begin{questions}
	\question[3] \textbf{Scenario:} an SMP instance with $n \ge 2$. \textbf{Statement:} there is exactly one stable matching.

	\question[4] \textbf{Scenario:} an SMP instance with $n \ge 2$ where all employers have identical preference lists. \textbf{Statement:} there is exactly one stable matching.
