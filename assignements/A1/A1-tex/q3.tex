\section{Red or Blue?}

Boolean satisfiability (SAT)  is, as far as  Computer Scientists know, a  hard problem. We
will define precisely what we mean by `hard', later on in the course. This problem is defined
as follows:
\begin{center}
	\fbox{
		\begin{minipage}{6in}
			The input  is a  collection of  $m$ \emph{clauses} over  $n$ boolean  variables $X_1$,
			$X_2$, \ldots $X_n$.  Each clause is a  disjunction of some of the  variables or their
			complements.\vskip8pt

			The problem consists in answering the question ``Is there a way to assign truth values
			to each variable that makes \textbf{every} clause of the instance \textsc{True}?'' (For short this is called a {\em valid truth assignment}.)
		\end{minipage}}
\end{center}
For instance, here is an instance of SAT made of 4 clauses over 3 variables:
\begin{displaymath}
	\begin{array}{rrl}
		\hbox to 20pt{\hfil} & 1. & X_1 \lor \overline{X}_3                     \\
		                     & 2. & \overline{X}_1 \lor \overline{X}_2 \lor X_3 \\
		                     & 3. & \overline{X}_2 \lor \overline{X}_3          \\
		                     & 4. & X_3                                         \\
	\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
Equivalently, you could think of this instance as the single boolean expression
\begin{displaymath}
	\begin{array}{rl}
		\hbox to 20pt{\hfil} & (X_1 \lor \overline{X}_3) \land {}                     \\
		                     & (\overline{X}_1 \lor \overline{X}_2 \lor X_3) \land {} \\
		                     & (\overline{X}_2 \lor \overline{X}_3) \land {}          \\
		                     & X_3                                                    \\
	\end{array}
\end{displaymath}

There are  many other problems  whose level  of difficulty is  similar to that  of Boolean
Satisfiability, and this problem has attracted a  lot of research. So while the problem is
difficult to solve  in general, a number of  tools to solve instances of  the problem have
been                       developed                        (see                       the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem}  {Wikipedia page}  for
details and  links). We can take  advantage of these  tools to solve other  problems using
\emph{reductions}.

In this question, we will  look at the problem of determining whether or  not a graph is a
\emph {split graph}. A graph $G = (V, E)$ is a \emph {split graph} if we can partition its
vertex set $V$ into two subsets $V_1$, $V_2$ such that $V = V_1 \cup V_2$, $V_1 \cap V_2 =
	\emptyset$, every  two vertices of  $V_1$ are  connected by an  edge ($\forall v  \in V_1,
	\forall w \in  V_1, \{ v, w \}  \in E$) and no  two vertices of $V_2$ are  connected by an
edge ($\forall  v \in V_2, \forall  w \in V_2,  \{ v, w  \} \notin E$). For  instance, the
following graph  is a split graph,  where the vertices of  $V_1$ are colored Red,  and the
vertices of $V_2$ are colored Blue.

\begin{questions}
	\question[4] Show how  to reduce an arbitrary  instance of the split  graph recognition problem
	into  an instance  of  \emph {Boolean  Satisfiability}  (SAT). (Remember that, per the problem specifications, your clauses must be in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form}{conjunctive normal form}.) Hint:  you  will want  to
	introduce a single variable for each vertex of the graph.

	\begin{soln}
		We have for any \(v_i \in V\) that either \(v_i \in V_1\) or \(v_i \in V_2\) but not both since they form a partition over \(V\).

		Then denote the boolean variable \(X_i\) so that

		\[
			X_i =
			\begin{cases}
				T, & \text{if vertice } i \in V_1 \\
				F, & \text{if vertice } i \in V_2
			\end{cases}
		\]

		We see if \(i, j \in V_1\) then they share an edge, similarly, if \(i, j \in V_2\) then they do not share an edge.

		If two vertices share an edge, we cannot tell if both are in \(V_1\) but we know at least one is.

		Hence, for for ever edge pair, \(\{i, j\}\) the disjunction is true, \((X_i \lor X_j)\).

		Now consider pairs \(\{i, j\} \notin E\), observe if pairs do not share an edge, then both are not in \(V_1\).

		In particular, the statement \(\lnot (X_i \land X_j )\) is true for every non-edge pair, equivalently, \((\lnot X_i \lor \lnot X_j)\) holds.

		Then we construct the SAT instance,

		\[
			\left(\bigwedge_{\{i, j\} \notin E}  (\lnot X_i \lor \lnot X_j)\right) \land \left(\bigwedge_{\{i, j\} \in E}(X_i \lor X_j)\right).
		\]

		If such a solution to this SAT instance exists, then \(G\) is a split graph.

	\question[1] Write the collection of clauses you would get for the following graph:

	\begin{soln}
		\[
			(\lnot X_0 \lor \lnot X_1), \quad (\lnot X_1 \lor \lnot X_4), \quad
			(\lnot X_1 \lor \lnot X_2), \quad (\lnot X_2 \lor \lnot X_3),
		\]
		\[
			(X_0 \lor  X_2), \quad
			(X_0 \lor  X_3), \quad
			(X_0 \lor  X_4), \quad
			(X_1 \lor  X_3), \quad
			(X_2 \lor  X_4), \quad
			(X_3 \lor  X_4)
		\]
	\end{soln}

	\question[3] Explain briefly why, if  an input graph is a split graph, then  there is a way to
	assign  values  to  the variables  in  the  instance  of  SAT that  makes  every  clause
	\textsc{True}.

	\begin{soln}
		If \(G = (V, E)\) is a split graph then let \(V_1, V_2\) be the respective partition as defined.

		We assign for each \(i \in V\),
		\[
			X_i =
			\begin{cases}
				T & \text{if } i \in V_1 \\
				F & \text{if } i \in V_2
			\end{cases}
		\]

		Having that \(V_1, V_2\) form a partition, this boolean variable is well defined.

		For each \(\{i, j\}\) either they form an edge or not. If they form an edge, then both cannot be in \(V_2\).

		Hence at least one is in \(V_1\), and thus, the corresponding clause, \(X_i \lor X_j\) is true.

		If they are not an edge, then both are not in \(V_1\). Thus, at least one is in \(V_2\). Hence, \(\lnot X_i \lor \lnot X_j\) is true.

		Having considered every possible clause in the reduced SAT instance, we have shown this is a satisfying truth assigment, and thus the SAT is satisfiable.

	\end{soln}

	\ifsolutions\input{q3c-sol.tex}\fi

	\question[3] Explain briefly why,  if there is a way to assign values  to the variables in the
	instance of SAT that  makes every clause \textsc{True}, then the  graph used to generate
	the instance must be  a split graph. Show how you would determine  which vertices of $G$
	belong to which of the two subsets of $V$.

	\begin{soln}
		Suppose that we have a satisfying truth assingment to the SAT.

		Then for each assignment \(X_i\), if \(X_i\) is true, we place vertex \(i\) in \(V_1\) and if false, we place it into \(V_2\).

		We now aim to show this makes \(G\) a split graph.

		Suppose that \(i, j \in V_1\) this means that both of \(X_i, X_j\) were true.

		Hence, this means that \(\lnot X_i \lor \lnot X_j\) is false. This corresponds to \(\{i, j\}\) not being an edge, but if it is false, then they must be a pair.

		Now, the other case if \(i, j \in V_2\) then each of \(X_i, X_j\) were false. In other words, \(X_i \lor X_j\) is false.

		This corresponds to \(\{i, j\}\) being an edge, but since it is false this means that they are not an edge pair.

		Now assume that \(V_1 \cap V_2 \neq \varnothing\), then there is some \(i\) in the intersection so that \(X_i\) is true and false.

		But this is a contradiction, since we assumed we were able to appropiately assign truth values to each boolean varibale, thus \(V_1, V_2\) form a partition of \(V\).
