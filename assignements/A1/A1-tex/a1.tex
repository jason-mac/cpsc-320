\begin{document}
	
	\maketitle
	\vspace{-0.5in} This assignment is due \textbf{Friday, July 11 at 7 PM}. Late submissions will not be accepted. Please follow these guidelines:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Prepare your  solution using \LaTeX \ and submit  a pdf file. Easiest will be to submit using
		the .tex file provided. For questions where you  need to select a circle, you can simply
		change \verb~\fillinMCmath~ to \verb~\fillinMCmathsoln~ .
		
		\item Enclose each paragraph of your solution with
		\verb~\begin{soln}Your solution here...\end{soln}~.
		\begin{soln}Your  solution will  then appear  in dark  blue\end{soln}, making  it a  lot
		easier for TAs to find what you wrote.
		
		\item   Submit   the    assignment   via   \href{https://gradescope.ca/}{GradeScope}. You will be get access to Gradescope on the 9th of July via an invite link. Your group must make  a \textbf{single} submission via one
		group member's account, marking all other group members in that submission \textbf{using
			GradeScope's interface}.
		
		\item  After uploading  to  Gradescope, link  each  question  with the  page  of your  pdf
		containing your solution. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	Before we  begin, a few  notes on pseudocode throughout  CPSC 320: Your  pseudocode should
	communicate your algorithm  clearly, concisely, correctly, and  without irrelevant detail.
	Reasonable use  of plain  English is  fine in  such pseudocode.  You should  envision your
	audience as a capable CPSC 320 student unfamiliar with the problem you are solving. You may \textbf{neither} include what we consider to be irrelevant coding details \textbf{nor} assume that  we understand the particular  language you
	chose. (So, for example,  do not write \texttt{\#include <iostream>} at  the start of your
	pseudocode,   and    avoid   language-specific   notation   like    C/C++/Java's   ternary
	(question-mark-colon) operator.)
	
	Remember also  to \textbf{justify/explain  your answers}. We  understand that  gauging how
	much  justification to  provide can  be tricky.  Inevitably, judgment  is applied  by both
	student and  grader as to how  much is enough, or  too much, and it's  frustrating for all
	concerned  when judgments  don't align.  Justifications/explanations need  not be  long or
	formal, but  should be  clear and  specific (referring  back to  lines of  pseudocode, for
	example). Proofs should be a bit more formal.
	
	On the  plus side, if  you choose an  incorrect answer when  selecting an option  but your
	reasoning shows partial  understanding, you might get more marks  than if no justification
	is provided. And  the effort you expend  in writing down the  justification will hopefully
	help you gain deeper  understanding and may well help you converge  to the right selection
	:).

	Ok, time to get started...
