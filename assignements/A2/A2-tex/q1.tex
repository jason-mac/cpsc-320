\section{Take Your Order}

[10 points] Take the following functions and arrange them in ascending order of growth rate. That is, if $g(n)$ appears after $f(n)$ in your ordering, it should be the case that $f(n) \in O(g(n))$. (Example: the functions $n$ and $n^2$ would appear in the order: $n, n^2$.) Justify your answer.

\begin{align*}
    f_1(n) &= n \\
    f_2(n) &= 2^n \\
    f_3(n) &= \sqrt{n} \log n \\
    f_4(n) &= \frac{n \log n}{\log(\log n )} \\
    f_5(n) &= (n-2)! \\
    f_6(n) &= n^{\lg n}
\end{align*}
