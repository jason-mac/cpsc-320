	Let \(P = (v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n)\) be a permutation on \(V\).

	We will assume that we have an adjency matrix to represent the edges in the graph \(M\).

	\begin{algorithmic}[1]
		\Procedure {Valid-Ranking}{P, M}
		\For{each $i = 1, 2, \dots, n - 1$}
		\State store the sum from $j = i$ to $j = n$ of $M(j)$ as $d_i$
		\For{each $j = i + 1, \dots, n - 1$}
		\State store the sum from $k = j$ to $k = n$ of $M(k)$ as $d_k$
		\If{$d_i < d_k$}
		\State end the procedure, report it is not valid
		\EndIf
		\EndFor
		\EndFor
		\State report the permutation as valid
		\EndProcedure
	\end{algorithmic}
	This algorithm is \(O(n^3)\), where \(n = |P|\). In the worse case, we have a valid permutation, and the algorithm does work as follows.

	We have to iterate through the permutation list \(n - 1\) times. Access to the elements will be \(O(1)\) as we assume we are given an array.

	Then for each iteration, we are iterating through the entire adjency matrix, except each iteration we are considering one less node.

	Access to the adjency matrix is \(O(1)\) thus the iteration of the adjency matrix is \(O(i^2)\).

	Then, for each \(i\), the work we are doing is \(i^2\). Thus, summing \(i = 1, 2, \dots, n - 1\) gives us \(O(n^3)\).
