\begin{soln}
	Sort the shifts in terms of ascending order by finish time, for any ties, place first the earliest start time.

	Choose the first shift in the ordered list, and add it to our solution set.

	Then delete any intersecting shifts to that shift and remove that shift itself from the ordered list.

	Continue to the next shift in the ordered list and repeat the previous steps until the list is empty.
