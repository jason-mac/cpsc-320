\begin{soln}
	Denote greedy solution by \(G = (g_1, g_2, \dots, g_k)\). It is clear that every shift intersects with itself.

	Let \(O = (o_1, o_2, \dots, o_l)\) be optimal solution whose shifts are ordered in the by finish time as in \(G\).

	Lemma: \(f(g_i) \leq f(o_i)\), for each \(i \leq \min(l, k)\).
\end{soln}
