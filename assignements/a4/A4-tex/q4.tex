\section{Constrained Shortest Paths}
A  company is leasing communication bandwidth from a national telecom provider to establish  a new connection between its office in Vancouver and its office in Newark.

The telecom provider's network is represented by a graph $G=(V,E)$ and each edge $(u,v)$ has an advertised price $p(u,v)$.  In addition, each edge
has a transit delay $d(u,v)$ due to node equipment. Suppose a new connection is to be established between two given nodes $s,t \in V$ and we require that the total delay between the two nodes be no more than $D$. Assume that all prices and delays are greater than 0. The company would therefore like to find the cheapest $st$-path which obeys  this constraint. In other words, the problem to solve is:
\[
	\min_{\mbox{$P$ an $st$-path}}  p(P) \textrm{ such that } d(P)\leq D
\]

Here $p(P)$ denotes the price of the path $P$ -- that is $\sum_{(u,v) \in P} p(u,v)$ -- and $d(P)$ denotes the total delay of the path $P$ -- that is, $\sum_{(u,v) \in P} d(u,v)$.

	\question[5] For each $v \in V$, define
	$P(\delta,v)$ to be  the minimum cost of a path from $s$ to $v$ with total communication delay at most $\delta$. Write a recurrence to define $P(\delta, v)$.

		First, define a base case, the path from \(s\) to itself will have cost zero, so long as the delay is non-negative.

		If delay is less then zero, we will give it a cost of ininfity, since delays are assumed to be non-negative.

		For the other cases, consider the last node in the path and the node that precedes it, denote it by \(u\).

		If \(u\) is going to precede it, then the path from \(s\) to \(u\) should have delay at most \(\delta - d(u, v)\).

		Since we want the minimized cost path, then \(P(\delta, v) = \min_{(u, v) \in E} (P(\delta - d(u, v), u) + p(u, v))\).

		\[
			P(\delta, v) = \begin{cases}
				0                                                      & \text{if } s = v \text{ and } \delta \geq 0 \\
				\infty                                                 & \text{ if } \delta < 0                      \\
				\min_{(u, v) \in E} (P(\delta - d(u, v), u) + p(u, v)) & \text{ otherwise }
			\end{cases}

	\question[7] Give a recursive memoized algorithm to solve for $P(D,v)$ for a given maximum delay $D$ and node $v$.

	\begin{soln}
		Assume that all relevant functions and arrays are defined.

		I.e. weight functions for delays \(d\), cost weight functions \(p\), adjacency lists, edge lists.
